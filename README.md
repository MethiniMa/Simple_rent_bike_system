# Simple_Bike_Rent_System
The system is designed to manage and track the operations of a bicycle rental business.

i) Bicycle rental options: 
    There are two types of bicycles available for rental: single-person and double-person bikes. The rental price varies depending on the type of bike and the duration of the rental. 1 represents single-person, 2 represents double-person bikes, and enter -1 to calculate the final result.

ii) Pricing rules: 
    For single-person bikes, rentals within 30 minutes are free of charge. If the rental exceeds 30 minutes but is less than 2 hours, the charge is $10 for every 30 minutes. If the rental exceeds 2 hours but is less than 4 hours, the charge is $20 for every 30 minutes. If the rental duration exceeds 4 hours, the charge is $40 for every 30 minutes.
    For double-person bikes, if the rental exceeds 30 minutes but is less than 2 hours, the charge is $16 for every 30 minutes. If the rental exceeds 2 hours but is less than 4 hours, the charge is $38 for every 30 minutes. If the rental duration exceeds 4 hours, the charge is $78 for every 30 minutes.

iii) Billing and display:
    The system can calculate the total quantity of single-person and double-person bikes rented and the corresponding rental fees. Finally, the system displays the total quantity of single-person or double-person bikes and the amount due.
